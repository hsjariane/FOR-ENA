    <h1>💖 My Feelings For You 💖</h1>

    <div class="message-container">
        <p>
        I know I don’t always say this, but I still love you, Ena. And honestly, I think that feeling keeps growing every single day. Sometimes I don’t know how to explain what I truly feel. It’s like my heart understands it, but my words can’t fully describe it. But even if I can’t perfectly say everything, I still want to try — because you deserve to hear it.
        <br><br>
        Please don’t ever feel guilty about the things I do for you. Everything I give, everything I say, everything I do — I do it because I want to. Not because I expect something in return. I don’t want you to feel like you owe me anything. Wala akong hinihinging kapalit. I just want you to enjoy being with me. I want you to feel safe, relaxed, and at peace when you’re with me. If I can give you even a little rest from your stress and problems, that’s already enough for me.
        <br><br>
        I love seeing you smile. Your smile makes my day brighter. But I also understand that life isn’t always happy. We both have our own struggles, our own problems, our own heavy days. And I don’t expect you to be strong all the time. I just want you to know that when you’re tired, when you’re sad, when everything feels too much — I want to be there. I want to be someone you can lean on. Not just during happy moments, but especially during the hardest ones.
        <br><br>
        Whenever I see you, my heart feels so full. I feel warm and calm when you’re around. It’s like my world slows down in the best way. Your presence alone already makes me happy. And I truly appreciate all the sacrifices and effort you’ve given me. I see it. I notice it. And I’m so thankful for every little thing you do, even the small ones you think don’t matter. They matter to me.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for staying. Thank you for being you.
        <br><br>
        I love you more than I can fully explain, but I hope you can feel it in the way I treat you, in the way I care for you, and in the way I choose you every single day. 💗
