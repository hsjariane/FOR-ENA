        I still remember the very first time we met. The first time that I notice you, you're so cute back then and you were in a roleplay. I know ayaw mo nang maalala pero doon kita unang nakita. It was funny and cute at the same time but meeting you would become one of the most important memories in my life. I remember how much I cared for you in the camping, not because I had romantic feelings towards you, but to be honest I don't know why I acted that way. It's just cute when you're around and for some reason when you opened up, I felt at ease and grateful at the same time, because you were already comfortable with me. I'm really glad.  
        <br><br>
        Since that day, every small moment we’ve shared has felt like a little treasure. The way you laugh, the little things you do, and even the way you just exist—it all left a mark on my heart. When I got heartbroken from my ex back then, you were the one who saved me, the one who didn’t leave my side, and the one who comforted me. I can honestly say that meeting you changed my perspective on how meaningful connections can be. I found myself smiling more, dreaming more, and hoping for more beautiful moments together.  
        <br><br>
        Even now, thinking back to that first encounter brings a warmth to my heart that I can’t describe. It was simple and cute, yet unforgettable, and it’s the kind of memory that I’ll carry with me forever. I’m grateful for that day, for that meeting, and for the start of a story I hope we’ll continue to write together, full of laughter, care, and sweet memories.
